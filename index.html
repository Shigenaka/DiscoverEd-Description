                Special education programs in the US are on the rise, with 30% growth over the last decade, and becoming an 
                umbrella program, encompassing both disability related programs and supplementary education programs. 
                Educators who work with high needs student populations have turned to technology like mobile and desktop 
                application that allow them to enhance their studentâ€™s experience, helping their students learn and achieve 
                at the highest possible level.
