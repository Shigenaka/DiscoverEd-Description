            <h3>Target Users</h3>
            <p>
                Educators who work in special educators looking to implement new technologies in their classroom, 
                who need recommendations on the technologies available and/or looking to form a collaborative community
                wit their peers.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Special education has found itself at the forefront of educational technology, since traditional textbooks 
                and worksheets are often ineffective. The implementation of assistive technology in special education classrooms 
                is on the rise, but information about these technologies is dispersed, and educators use precious time scouring 
                the internet for answers instead of developing lesson plans and curriculum. During our initial research, Educators 
                also experience difficulty collaborating with others within their their own schools, due to office politics and
                departmental drama.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>DiscoverEd aims to provide these educators with the ability to discover technologies to address the needs of their students. 
                In a mobile-first web application, we use a concise survey distributed to new users to gain an understanding of their 
                classroom to provide recommendations. Through this and user-generated reviews and forum posts, we hope to foster a 
                collaborative, invaluable community for educators working in special education.
