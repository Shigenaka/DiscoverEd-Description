            <p>
                Special education has historically been defined as a form of learning provided to students with exceptional needs, such as students with learning disabilities or mental challenges.
                However as primary and secondary education environments change, so has special education. Special education programs are on the rise with a 30 percent increase in the past decade.
                Specail education has also evolved, becoming an umbrella term for educating high needs student populations, including supplemental education.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Assitive or adptive technology are technologies that teachers can use to help their students learn and achieve at the highest possible level. Special education is a significant 
                adopter of assisitve technology, due to the recognition of the ineffectiveness of traditional textbooks and worksheets. However teachers invest precious time looking for the right
                technology to fit the needs of their students.
            </p>
            <p>
                DiscoverEd aims to provide educators working with high needs populations with the ability to discover technologies to address the needs of their students, and to foster a collaborative
                community for feedback and insight.
